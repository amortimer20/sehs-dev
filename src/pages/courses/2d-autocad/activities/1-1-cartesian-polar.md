# Activity 1 Cartesian and Polar Coordinates

## Introduction

As an Engineer, Architect, Construction manager, or any job that involves the development of a product (eg: Buildings, Toys, Household products, etc.), you will need to know how to create/read blueprints. AutCAD, a 2-dimensional software, allows the user to create such blueprints. 

A 2-dimensional software utilizes an X/Y coordinate system just like you have learned in your math courses. The X-dimension refers to the horizontal movement, and the Y-dimension refers to the vertical movement (eg: 2,3 means 2 spaces right and 3 spaces up).

AutoCAD can utilize a second form of point plotting called Polar coordinates. Polar coordinates utilize a circle to determine distance and angle traveled from the center of the circle. Polar coordinates are written in the form @d < a where d=distance and a=angle. The distance refers to the distance from the last point (eg: P1 --> P2 or P2 --> P3). The angle refers to the angle between the two points (eg: P1 --> P2 or P2 --> P3).

## Tips, Tricks, and Reflection

- What skills or previous knowledge did you utilize to complete these worksheets?
- Do you have to know trigonomotry to make complex shapes in 2D sofware?
- Fun fact: AutoCAD doesn't care which method (cartesian or polar) you choose, and you can switch between the two freely.
