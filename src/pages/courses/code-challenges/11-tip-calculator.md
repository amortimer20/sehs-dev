# Code Challenge 11 - Tip Calculator

## Introduction

Let's be honest, you're probably a cheapskate. _You_ need a program that allows you to calculate how much you are supposed to tip.

### Terms

**Bill/Subtotal** - How much your food and drink cost

**Tip/Gratuity** - How much money you would like to give your server. Usually 18% - 20% of the subtotal.

**Total** - Final cost: bill + tip.

### Examples

- A $10 bill with 20% tip
  - Tip $2
  - Total $12
- A $25 bill with 18% tip
  - Tip $4.50
  - Total $29.50

### Skills to Practice

- Getting numeric user input
- Save user input to variables
- Perform arithmetic
- Format output strings using variables and expressions

## Challenge Tasks

1. Prompt the user to enter their bill amount.
2. Prompt the user to enter their tip percentage as a whole number. i.e. 20 means 20%.
3. Calculate how much the user should tip and the total.
