# Code Challenge 6 - Inches to Height Calculator

## Introduction

This calculator code challenge is deceivingly more challenging than the previous challenges. The formula for this calculator makes use of the modulus operator (%). Remember, the modulus operator, or mod for short, performs division and returns the remainder.

This calculator converts the user's height in inches and converts it to feet and inches. For example, I'm 70 inches tall. That means I'm 5 foot 10 inches.

### Skills to Practice

- Prompt a user for input
- Save user input to variables
- Perform a calculation using the modulus operator
- Format custom output using variables

## Challenge Tasks

1. Open your code editor and create a new program title "_InchesToHeight Calculator_".
2. Remember, if you complete this challenge using Node.js, then you need to import the package, "readline-sync".
3. Complete the folowing tasks:
   1. Prompt the user to enter their height in inches.
   2. Convert the height in inches to feet **and** inches.
   3. Output the result to the user.
