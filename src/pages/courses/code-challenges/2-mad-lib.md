# Code Challenge 2 - Mad Lib

## Introduction

A mad lib is a simple word game where the player is asked to provide a number of words such as a noun, food, place, verb, adjective, etc. The player is then provided a silly story that has their words inserted into specific places. Try a mad lib out [here](http://www.madtakes.com/libs/176.html) if you've never played one before.

### Skills to Practice

- Prompt a user for input
- Save user input to variables
- Format custom output using variables

## Challenge Tasks

1. Open your code editor and create a new program title "_MadLibChallenge_".
2. Remember, if you complete this challenge using Node.js, then you need to import the package, "readline-sync".
3. Complete the folowing tasks:
   1. Output a story title at the beginning of your program.
   2. Prompt the user to input two nouns and save them each to a variable.
   3. Prompt the user to input two numbers and save it to a variable.
   4. Invoke `console.log()` four times to create a story that is four lines long. Create a story and use the variables throughout the story to create a story template.
