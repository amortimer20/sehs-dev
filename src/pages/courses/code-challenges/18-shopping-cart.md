# Code Challenge 18 - Shopping Cart

## Introduction

The shopping cart app is similar to any application that allows a user to create lists to remember what they need to do. This application specifically allows the user to create a list of items to purchase when shopping. The difference in this application from similar activities is the different functionality available in this application. Users can perform the following tasks:

- Add items to the cart
- Remove items from the cart
- List the cart contents

### Skills to Practice

- Adding elements to an array.
- Finding elements of an array.
- Deleting elements of an array.
- Iterating over elements of an array.

## Challenge Tasks
1. Create a new program titled "*Shopping Cart*"

    1. Add an item to cart
    2. Show contents of cart

4. Allow the user to add an item to the shopping cart.
    1. If the item already exists in the cart, don't add the duplicate item.
