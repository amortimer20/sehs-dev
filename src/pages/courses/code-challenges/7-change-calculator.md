# Code Challenge 7 - Change Calculator

## Introduction

When a cashier performs transactions at a register, they quickly learn how to give back change efficiently. You start with the largest coin denomination and work your way down until you have exact change. For example, if the cahsier needs to give back 55 cents, they would take out two quarters and one nickel. You could technically give back 55 pennies, 5 dimes and a nickel, or some other nonsense, but it's arguably less efficient.

### Skills to Practice

- Prompt a user for input
- Save user input to variables
- Perform a calculation using the modulus operator
- Format custom output using variables

## Challenge Tasks

1. Open your code editor and create a new program title "_Change Calculator_".
2. Remember, if you complete this challenge using Node.js, then you need to import the package, "readline-sync".
3. Complete the folowing tasks:
   1. Prompt the user to enter how much change to give back. The value should be between 1-99.
   2. Calculate the number for each coin: quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
   3. Output the number of each coin to give back.
