# Introduction to the C# Programming Language

## Wikipedia

The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.

## Language Specifics

- C# is statically typed, meaning once the data type for a variable is declared, it cannot change.
- C# use JIT compilation provided by the .NET Framework.
- The .NET Framework is available on all major platforms, including Linux, shortly after it was open sourced.
