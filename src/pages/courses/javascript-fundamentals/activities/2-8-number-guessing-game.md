## Activity Instructions

### Setup

1. Create a new repl.
   1. Select _Node.js_ for the language.
   2. Name the Repl "_2.8 Number Guessing Game_".
2. Click Create repl.

### Code

```javascript
var readline = require("readline-sync")

var secretNumber = parseInt(Math.random() * 10 + 1)
var tries = 0 // Track number of tries
var guess // Declared variables without a value are undefined

while (guess != secretNumber) {
  guess = parseInt(readline.question("Guess the number (1-10): "))
  tries++

  if (guess == secretNumber) {
    console.log(`Correct! It took you ${tries} tries!`)
  } 
  else if (guess > secretNumber) {
    console.log("Wrong! Too high.")
  } 
  else {
    console.log("Wrong! Too low.")
  }
}
```
