# What are JavaScript?

## Introduction

JavaScript is the programming language of the web. Every single web browser has a version JavaScript built into it. Therefore, every single computer with a web browser can execute JavaScript! Though originally made for the web, JavaScript can be used to build desktop apps, mobile apps, video games, and more.

There are essentially two ways to write JavaScript and run apps: there are browser based versions of JavaScript, and there is a JavaScript platform called **Node.js**, or Node for short. Node.js is a platform that allows you to run JavaScript applications _outside_ of a web browser.

Some of the most popular desktop, mobile, and web apps are built with JavaScript:

- Netflix
- Hulu
- Facebook
- AirBnB
- Instagram
- Uber Eats
- Discord
- Slack
- Twitch
- WhatsApp
- Pretty much everything useful on the web

## Sample Exercise

Try this out: open up Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. Hit the _F12_ key on your keyboard to open up the developer tools. Find the tab labeled **console**. The developer console allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

Type the following line into the console and press _enter_:

```js
alert("Hello!")
```
